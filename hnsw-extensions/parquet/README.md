# Parquet-based HNSW Implementation

This package provides a persistent implementation of the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph algorithm using Apache Parquet for storage. The implementation is designed to efficiently store and retrieve high-dimensional vectors while maintaining the graph structure on disk.

## Features

- Persistent storage of HNSW graph using Apache Parquet files
- Efficient vector storage and retrieval
- Support for batch operations
- Memory-mapped file access for improved performance
- Configurable graph parameters (M, Ml, EfSearch)
- Support for different distance metrics
- Incremental updates with automatic compaction

## How It Works

The Parquet-based HNSW implementation consists of several key components that work together to provide efficient vector storage, retrieval, and search capabilities:

### Architecture

1. **ParquetGraph**: The main graph structure that implements the HNSW algorithm. It maintains the in-memory representation of the graph layers and handles search operations.

2. **ParquetStorage**: Manages the underlying Parquet files for storing vectors, layers, and neighbor connections.

3. **VectorStore**: Handles efficient storage and retrieval of vectors, with caching and batch operations.

4. **IncrementalStore**: Manages incremental updates to vectors, tracking additions, updates, and deletions.

### Data Storage

The implementation uses four main Parquet files:

1. **vectors.parquet**: Stores the actual vector data, mapping keys to their corresponding vectors.
2. **layers.parquet**: Stores the layer structure of the graph, indicating which nodes exist in each layer.
3. **neighbors.parquet**: Stores the connections between nodes in each layer.
4. **metadata.parquet**: Stores metadata about the graph, such as dimensions and configuration.

For incremental updates, additional files are created in the `vector_changes` directory, which track changes to vectors over time.

### Search Process

The search process follows the standard HNSW algorithm:

1. Start at a random entry point in the top layer.
2. Perform a greedy search in the current layer to find the closest node to the query.
3. Use that node as the entry point for the next layer down.
4. Repeat until reaching the bottom layer (layer 0).
5. In the bottom layer, perform a more thorough search with a larger candidate set.
6. Return the k closest nodes to the query.

The implementation includes several optimizations to make this process efficient:

- **Vector Caching**: Frequently accessed vectors are cached in memory to reduce disk I/O.
- **Batch Vector Retrieval**: When searching, vectors are retrieved in batches to minimize Parquet file operations.
- **Early Termination**: The search algorithm stops exploring candidates when they can't improve the current result set.
- **Parallel Processing**: Vector retrieval and distance calculations can be performed in parallel for better performance.

```

### Interpretation

- **Add**: Adding a single node takes approximately 5.24ms with moderate memory allocation.
- **BatchAdd**: Adding a batch of 10 nodes takes approximately 355ms, which is about 35.5ms per node. While this is slower than individual adds in total time, it's more efficient for large-scale operations as it reduces the overhead of multiple disk writes.
- **Search**: Searching for nearest neighbors takes approximately 128μs per operation, which is very fast.
- **Delete**: Deleting nodes takes approximately 2.37ms per operation with moderate memory allocation.

### Reopening Performance

One of the key optimizations in this implementation is the improved performance when reopening a graph from disk. In our example with 1,000 vectors:

- Initial search on a newly created graph: ~56μs
- Search on a reopened graph: ~221ms

This is a significant improvement from previous versions where reopening could take several minutes (5+ minutes in earlier implementations). The optimizations that contributed to this improvement include:

1. Automatic compaction of incremental changes during reopening
2. Efficient caching of base vectors and change logs
3. Parallel processing of vector retrievals
4. Lazy loading of vectors instead of eager preloading

The reopening performance scales well with the size of the dataset, making this implementation practical for real-world applications with large vector collections.

## Incremental Updates

The implementation supports incremental updates, which allows for efficient handling of frequent vector additions, updates, and deletions without the need to rewrite the entire dataset each time.

### How Incremental Updates Work

1. **Change Tracking**: When vectors are added, updated, or deleted, these changes are first stored in memory and then written to incremental change log files.

2. **Change Log Files**: Changes are stored in Parquet files in the `vector_changes` directory, with each file containing a batch of changes. Each change includes the key, the operation type (add/delete), the vector data (for adds), and a timestamp.

3. **Vector Retrieval**: When retrieving a vector, the system first checks the in-memory changes, then the change log files (from newest to oldest), and finally the base vector store. This ensures that the most recent version of a vector is always returned.

4. **Automatic Compaction**: When the number of changes exceeds a configurable threshold or after a certain time period, the changes are automatically compacted into the main storage. This process:
   - Reads all vectors from the base store
   - Applies all changes from the change logs
   - Writes the updated vectors back to the base store
   - Removes the change log files

5. **Caching**: To improve performance, vectors are cached in memory after retrieval, reducing the need to read from disk for frequently accessed vectors.

### Configuration

The `IncrementalConfig` struct allows customization of incremental update behavior:

- `MaxChanges`: Maximum number of changes before compaction (default: 1000)
- `MaxAge`: Maximum age of changes before compaction (default: 1 hour)

## Recent Optimizations

Several optimizations have been implemented to improve performance:

1. **Base Vector Caching**: The entire base vector store can be loaded into memory once and cached, significantly improving performance for repeated operations.

2. **Change Log Caching**: The list of change log files is cached and reused, avoiding repeated directory scans.

3. **Parallel Vector Retrieval**: When retrieving multiple vectors, the operations are performed in parallel using goroutines, with a semaphore to limit concurrency.

4. **Automatic Compaction on Reopen**: When reopening a graph, incremental changes are automatically compacted, improving search performance on reopened graphs.

5. **Lazy Loading**: Vectors are loaded lazily when needed, rather than preloading all vectors at once, which can cause performance issues for large graphs.

6. **Optimized Search Algorithm**: The search algorithm has been optimized to reduce unnecessary vector retrievals and distance calculations.

### Usage Example

```go
// Create a configuration with incremental updates
config := DefaultParquetGraphConfig()
config.Storage.Directory = "/path/to/storage"
config.Incremental.MaxChanges = 500 // Compact after 500 changes
config.Incremental.MaxAge = 30 * time.Minute // Compact after 30 minutes

// Create a new graph
graph, err := NewParquetGraph[int](config)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
defer graph.Close()

// Add vectors - these will be stored incrementally
for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
    node := hnsw.Node[int]{
        Key:   i,
        Value: generateVector(128), // Your vector generation function
    }
    err = graph.Add(node)
    if err != nil {
        // Handle error
    }
}

// Delete some vectors - these will be tracked incrementally
for i := 0; i < 100; i += 10 {
    graph.Delete(i)
}

// Close the graph - this will ensure all changes are persisted
graph.Close()
```

## Optimizations

The implementation includes several optimizations:

1. **Vector Caching**: Frequently accessed vectors are cached in memory to reduce disk I/O.
2. **Batch Operations**: Support for batch adding and retrieving vectors to reduce overhead.
3. **Memory Mapping**: Files can be memory-mapped for faster access.
4. **Early Termination**: Search algorithm uses early termination to avoid unnecessary distance calculations.
5. **Priority Queues**: Efficient priority queues are used for candidate selection during search.
6. **Incremental Updates**: Changes are tracked incrementally and compacted periodically to improve write performance.
7. **Parallel Processing**: Vector operations are performed in parallel where possible.

## Usage

```go
// Create a new graph
config := DefaultParquetGraphConfig()
config.Storage.Directory = "/path/to/storage"
config.M = 16
config.EfSearch = 100
config.Distance = hnsw.CosineDistance

graph, err := NewParquetGraph[int](config)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
defer graph.Close()

// Add nodes
nodes := []hnsw.Node[int]{
    {Key: 1, Value: []float32{0.1, 0.2, 0.3}},
    {Key: 2, Value: []float32{0.4, 0.5, 0.6}},
}
err = graph.Add(nodes...)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

// Search
query := []float32{0.2, 0.3, 0.4}
results, err := graph.Search(query, 5)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

// Delete
deleted := graph.Delete(1)
```

## Configuration

The `ParquetGraphConfig` struct allows customization of various parameters:

- `M`: Maximum number of connections per node (default: 16)
- `Ml`: Level generation factor (default: 0.25)
- `EfSearch`: Size of dynamic candidate list during search (default: 20)
- `Distance`: Distance function (default: CosineDistance)
- `Storage`: Storage configuration (directory, compression, etc.)
- `Incremental`: Incremental update configuration

## Storage Configuration

The `ParquetStorageConfig` struct allows customization of storage parameters:

- `Directory`: Directory where Parquet files will be stored
- `Compression`: Compression codec to use (default: Snappy)
- `BatchSize`: Batch size for reading/writing (default: 64MB)
- `MaxRowGroupLength`: Maximum row group length (default: 64MB)
- `DataPageSize`: Data page size (default: 1MB)
- `MemoryMap`: Whether to memory map files when reading (default: true)

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance, consider the following:

1. **Memory Mapping**: Enable memory mapping for faster file access, especially for large datasets.
2. **Batch Operations**: Use batch operations (Add with multiple nodes) whenever possible.
3. **EfSearch Parameter**: Adjust the EfSearch parameter based on your needs - higher values give more accurate results but slower search times.
4. **Compaction Frequency**: Adjust the MaxChanges and MaxAge parameters based on your update patterns.
5. **Cache Size**: The vector cache size can be adjusted based on available memory.
6. **Parallel Processing**: The implementation uses parallel processing for vector operations, which can be tuned based on your hardware.

## Limitations

1. **Memory Usage**: For very large datasets, memory usage can be high due to caching.
2. **Write Performance**: While incremental updates improve write performance, compaction operations can still be expensive.
3. **Concurrent Access**: The implementation is thread-safe, but concurrent writes may be serialized.

## Future Improvements

Planned improvements include:

1. **Distributed Storage**: Support for distributed storage backends.
2. **Improved Concurrency**: Better support for concurrent writes.
3. **Compression Options**: More options for vector compression.
4. **Query Filtering**: Support for filtering search results based on metadata.
5. **Hybrid Storage**: Combination of in-memory and disk-based storage for optimal performance.
