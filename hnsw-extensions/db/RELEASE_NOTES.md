# üèπ Quiver v1.0.0 Release Notes

We're thrilled to announce the initial release of Quiver, a high-performance vector database built in Go!

## What is Quiver?

Quiver is an experimental vector database that combines the best of HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) graphs with complementary search techniques. It's designed to be fast, flexible, and developer-friendly, with a focus on real-world use cases for vector search.

> **Note:** Quiver is currently experimental. While it's packed with exciting features, it's still finding its feet in the world. Feel free to play with it, but maybe don't bet your production system on it just yet!

## Key Features

### üîç Smart Search Strategy

- **Hybrid Search**: Automatically selects the optimal search strategy based on dataset size and query characteristics
- **Adaptive Learning**: Improves search performance over time by learning from query patterns
- **Multiple Index Types**: Supports HNSW, exact search, and LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing)

### üè∑Ô∏è Rich Metadata & Filtering

- **JSON Metadata**: Attach arbitrary JSON metadata to vectors
- **Faceted Search**: Filter results based on facet attributes
- **Negative Examples**: Improve relevance by providing examples of what you don't want

### üíæ Durability & Data Management

- **Parquet Storage**: Efficient, columnar storage format for vectors and metadata
- **Backup & Restore**: Create snapshots of your database and restore when needed
- **Optimized Batch Operations**: Efficiently add, update, and delete vectors in batches

### üîß Developer Experience

- **Fluent Query API**: Intuitive, chainable interface for constructing queries
- **Type Safety**: Leverages Go generics for type-safe operations
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear examples and explanations

### üìä Performance & Analytics

- **Graph Quality Metrics**: Analyze index quality and performance
- **Query Statistics**: Track query performance and success rates
- **Optimized Memory Usage**: Efficient memory management for large datasets

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture

Quiver integrates multiple components to provide a comprehensive vector search solution:

1. **Core Index**: A hybrid approach that combines HNSW, exact search, and LSH
2. **Metadata Layer**: Efficient storage and retrieval of JSON metadata
3. **Facets Layer**: Fast filtering based on structured attributes
4. **Storage Layer**: Durable, efficient Parquet-based storage
5. **Analytics**: Built-in performance monitoring and optimization

### Performance

Initial benchmarks show promising results:

- **Vector Addition**: ~1.48ms per vector (single), ~0.74ms per vector (batch)
- **Vector Search**: ~32Œºs per query
- **Filtered Search**: ~31Œºs per query
- **Backup/Restore**: ~19.8ms for database operations

### API Design

Quiver features a clean, intuitive API designed for developer productivity:

```go
// Create query options using the fluent API
options := quiverDB.DefaultQueryOptions().
    WithK(5).                                                // Return top 5 results
    WithFacetFilters(facets.NewEqualityFilter("category", "finance")).  // Add facet filter
    WithNegativeExample([]float32{0.9, 0.8, 0.7}).          // Example of what we don't want
    WithNegativeWeight(0.7)                                  // Higher weight for negative examples
```

## Getting Started

Check out our [README.md](README.md) for detailed installation instructions and usage examples.

## Roadmap

We're just getting started! Here's what we're planning for future releases:

- **Distributed Search**: Search across multiple nodes
- **Query Caching**: Speed up repeated queries
- **Incremental Updates**: Update your index more efficiently
- **Advanced Filtering**: More powerful filtering capabilities
- **Vector Compression**: Reduce memory usage
- **Cloud Storage**: Store your vectors in the cloud
- **Incremental Backups**: Save space with smarter backups
- **Streaming Updates**: Update your index in real-time

## Acknowledgments

Quiver builds on the excellent HNSW implementation from the TFMV/hnsw library, with extensions for hybrid search, metadata, facets, and persistent storage.
